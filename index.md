<!-- # Welcome to BIRDS Bus Open Source

Kyushu Institute of Technology is promoting BIRDS Bus Open Source activities.

The aim is to share know-how and technical information regarding CubeSat development -- with a focus on the BIRDS Bus. This satellite bus was developed at Kyutech as a spin-off of the BIRDS Program (2015-2022).

## Mission

The main goal is to provide a more solid basis for space programs in non-space faring countries by making satellite development easier, quicker, and less expensive. Starting from scratch is too much work.

### Join our webinars

We have a monthly Webinar to discuss various issues related to the satellite bus. To obtain the information (Zoom connections etc.,) about the Webinars, [please click here](./mailing-list.html).. You can find the transcripts and recordings of past webinars on this page.
