# Delta Lab
Is a research laboratory located at the Electromechanical Engineering Faculty at Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Cartago Campus. Its objective is to provide a space where researchers from Tecnológico de Costa Rica can work on their projects within a multidisciplinary environment.

Fields currently being worked on include IoT, Industry 4.0, Automation, Additive Manufacturing, Plasma and Material Sciences.

## Active projects:
### Three-phase compressor monitoring and cloud uploading firmware with ESP32 (Erick Quirós Gómez)

### LoRa based control and logging IoT system for acueduct ASADA-Sámara (Sergio Solórzano Alfaro)

This project presents the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies as a key tool in the compilation of water data that will be input for the management of water resources for the main aqueduct of ASADA. The intercommunication of Arad Octave hydro metering devices, liquid level sensors on main tank and the electrical control for pump station was proposed, through the use of a LoRaWAN network and the MQTT communication protocol for remote operation and data publication on the IoT Adafruit IO platform.

### ESP32 based embedded logger and cloud uploader for wind turbine efficiency data for LIENE (Nestor Martinez Soto)
Development of a low-cost system for wind turbine efficiency data gathering and logging. It shall allow the Wind Energy Research Lab (LIENE) log and visualize operation data, which increases it's capabilities for future projects.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
