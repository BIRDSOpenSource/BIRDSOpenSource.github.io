# What is BIRDS Open Source?
{: .text-purple-200}
BIRDS Open Source is a library of resources that will cover the entire satellite mission lifetime from start to finish. It aims to provide the knowledge to help you create your own open source satellite, using workflows you're familiar with and open-source tools you can trust.

Out of the box, Backstage includes:

* Backstage Software Catalog for managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, websites, ML models, etc.).

* Backstage Software Templates to spin up new projects quickly and standardize your tooling with your organization’s best practices.

* Backstage TechDocs that makes it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs-like code approach".

* A growing ecosystem of open source plugins that further expand Backstage’s customizability and functionality.

## Benefits of the BIRDS Open Source
{: .text-purple-200}
Here are some of the benefits of the BIRDS Open Source for people in different fields:
* **For engineering managers:** It makes it easy to maintain standards and best practices across the organization. It also can help you manage your tech ecosystem, from migrations to test certifications.

**For end users (developers):** It provides a central place to manage all projects and documentation and thus results in faster building of software components in standardized ways.

* **For platform engineers:** The BIRDS Open Source enables extensibility and scalability by letting you easily integrate new tools and services (via plugins). It also allows for extending the functionality of existing ones.

And for every other person, it’s a single, consistent experience that ties all your infrastructure tooling, resources, standards, owners, contributors, and administrators together in one place.
