## What is BIRDS Open Source?
{: .text-purple-200}
BIRDS Open Source is a library of resources that will cover the entire mission lifetime from start to finish. It aims to provide the knowledge to help you create your own open source satellite mission, using workflows you're familiar with and open-source tools you can trust.

Out of the box, Backstage includes:

Backstage Software Catalog for managing all your software (microservices, libraries, data pipelines, websites, ML models, etc.)

Backstage Software Templates for quickly spinning up new projects and standardizing your tooling with your organization’s best practices

Backstage TechDocs for making it easy to create, maintain, find, and use technical documentation, using a "docs like code" approach

Plus, a growing ecosystem of open source plugins that further expand Backstage’s customizability and functionality

# Benefits
{: .text-purple-200}
For engineering managers, it allows you to maintain standards and best practices across the organization, and can help you manage your whole tech ecosystem, from migrations to test certification.

For end users (developers), it makes it fast and simple to build software components in a standardized way, and it provides a central place to manage all projects and documentation.

For platform engineers, it enables extensibility and scalability by letting you easily integrate new tools and services (via plugins), as well as extending the functionality of existing ones.

For everyone, it’s a single, consistent experience that ties all your infrastructure tooling, resources, standards, owners, contributors, and administrators together in one place.
