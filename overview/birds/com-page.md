The ICDs in English and Japanese or the BIRDS**3** satellite can be found [***here***](https://github.com/BIRDSOpenSource/BIRDS3-COM).
And the ones for the BIRDS**4** satellite can be found [***here***](https://github.com/BIRDSOpenSource/BIRDS4-COM).

While they are the same, we are keeping them separate to maintain order.

In the March 2022 BIRDS Meeting a team presented their use of the Radiometrix HX1 COMs module with the BIRDS platform. Its datasheet has been added to the repositories.
