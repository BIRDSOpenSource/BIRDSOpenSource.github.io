The Joint Global Multi-Nations Birds Satellite project, or BIRDS project for short, was established by the Kyushu Institute of Technology ([_Kyutech_](https://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english/)) to help countries build their first satellite. Young engineers from select countries get to learn about space engineering at Kyutech, mostly using the 1U CubeSat. 
A 1U CubeSat is a nanosatellite with a form factor of 1Unit or 1U measuring 10x10x10 cms. CubeSats are useful as they provide a cost-effective platform for science investigations, new technology demonstrations, and other useful concepts. 

The BIRDS project has two main objectives:

1. Experience the entire cycle of a satellite project, from mission definition to operation, in a hands-on manner.
2. Have a strategy for sustainability after the training.

It should be emphasized that the primary goal is not the building of a satellite, but to have a long-term and sustainable space program established in each member country. So far, there have been 4 completed and one ongoing BIRDS missions.

1. BIRDS-1: Bangladesh, Japan, Mongolia, Ghana and Nigeria.
2. BIRDS-2: Bhutan, The Philipines and Malaysia.
3. BIRDS-3: Japan, Sri Lanka and Nepal
4. BIRDS-4: Japan, The Philipines, Paraguay.
5. BIRDS-5: Japan, Uganda and Zimbabwe.

Kyutech initiated a long-term fellowship program, DNST/PNST (Doctorate in NanoSatellite Technology/ Postgraduate study in NanoSatellite Technology), in 2011 in collaboration with the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) to promote the space capacity building of non-space-faring nations. The institution also started the Space Engineering International Course (SEIC) in 2013 as a postgraduate program.

Two or three young engineers are sent from each participating country to Kyutech as full-time graduate students to learn space engineering using 1U CubeSat development work. The BIRDS program is designed so that each generation of satellites can be finished in two years, from mission definition to operation. Including operation in two years is critical to fit the entire satellite project into a master’s degree course study timeline, which is two years.

## The Documentation Project Team

The effort to release and maintain this documentation to the public is done for Kyutech University by a small team from Costa Rica. The supervising professor, Juan José Rojas, obtained his PhD from the BIRDS Program detailed in the textbook.
