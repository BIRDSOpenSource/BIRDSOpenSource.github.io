The BIRDS project, initiated by Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech), helps countries build their first satellite. It has completed 4 missions and one is ongoing:

1. BIRDS-1: Bangladesh, Japan, Mongolia, Ghana, Nigeria  
2. BIRDS-2: Bhutan, Philippines, Malaysia  
3. BIRDS-3: Japan, Sri Lanka, Nepal  
4. BIRDS-4: Japan, Philippines, Paraguay  
5. BIRDS-5: Japan, Uganda, Zimbabwe  

The primary goal is not just building a satellite, but establishing a sustainable space program in each country. Kyutech's fellowship programs (PNST) and Space Engineering International Course (SEIC) provide hands-on space engineering training using CubeSat development, enabling each mission to be completed in two years. The goal of open sourcing the process is to enable teams from across the world to develop their own country-first satellites.
