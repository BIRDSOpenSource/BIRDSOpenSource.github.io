# Design and Architecture

Understanding CubeSat Electrical Power Systems (EPS) and BPB Integration

Power distribution architecture in CubeSats.
Voltage levels and current requirements for subsystems.
Data Bus Protocols for Backplane Boards

Common protocols: I2C, CAN, UART, SPI, and SpaceWire.
How to select and implement appropriate protocols.
Signal Integrity in Backplane Design

Mitigating noise, crosstalk, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
PCB trace routing and grounding techniques.
Connector Selection and Placement

Types of connectors for CubeSat BPBs (e.g., Hirose, Samtec).
Strategies for minimizing failures during vibration and thermal testing.
