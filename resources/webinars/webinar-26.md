This presentation will provide an update on recent improvements to the BIRDS Open
Source community pages and documentation website, highlighting new features and
navigation aids designed to support users and contributors. A live demonstration will
showcase how users can now more easily find information, contribute, and engage
with the project’s resources.
The presentation will also contextualize these updates within ongoing research on the
impact of visual and interactive documentation on CubeSat flight software reuse—a
key consideration for educational satellite projects and emerging spacefaring nations.
Attendees will learn how the integration of user-friendly, interactive documentation
can enhance collaboration and lower the barrier to entry for new teams.
The talk will conclude with an open invitation for feedback, aiming to incorporate
community perspectives into the continuous improvement of the BIRDS Open Source
project.
