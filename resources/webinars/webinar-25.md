Japan, for research in Space and Earth Electromagnetism in 2013. <br> As an
academician, he has supervised more than 20 postgraduate students, led more
than 10 research grants, and published over 100 publications. His research interest
are Satellite Engineering and System, Space and Earth Electromagnetism and
Wireless Instrumentation and Communication Systems. <br> He has been appointed as
Visiting Professor at Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan since 2018 until now.
Other than his career at university, Dr Mohamad Huzaimy holds positions as CoChairman, Visiting Engineer and Technical Consultant at several satellite-related
companies and ministry level in special projects such as Space Weather mitigation
and National Satellite project.

**Dr. Fatimah Zaharah Ali** is a senior lecturer at College of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM),
Malaysia since 2012. <br> She obtained her Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronics from
Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP), Perak, Malaysia in 2009; MSc. in Telecommunication and Information
Engineering from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Selangor, Malaysia in 2012; and PhD in Electrical
Engineering, UiTM, Selangor, Malaysia in 2023. <br> She also had worked as an Assistant Manager in Telekom
Malaysia (TM) Berhad in 2010 for a year before she pursued her master’s degree. <br>
Her study in Communication Engineering has led her to start the research in satellite field for doctorate
degree. Her thesis was on the complete process on developing the imaging mission system payload with high
resolution for the application of 1U-sized CubeSat; which also includes the integration and space
environments tests with the other subsystems boards of the satellite.
In 2021, she was appointed as Project Manager for the international collaborative project, ASEANSAT, with
associates from Philippines, Thailand, Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MOSTI), and
Malaysian Space Agency (MYSA). ASEANSAT is the project of developing and launching the second satellite
CubeSat of UiTM, local to Malaysia. Apart of managing the project, she was responsible for the camera
mission, satellite testing and integration, satellite registration, licensing, and frequency coordination. <br> When
she was appointed as UiTM Ground Station Manager in 2019, she had actively participated in the BIRDS
Ground Station Workshops and as Malaysian Editor for BIRDS Project Newsletter, representing UiTM and
Malaysia. Due to her commitment and enthusiasm in satellite field, Fatimah was invited by various local and
international organizations where she readily shared her experience and insights in the space and satellite
field. <br> Moreover, she was invited by NASA-associated Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM) to be part
of the Working Group Member on International Collaboration in Space Technology Conclave that was held in
Chennai, India, in 2022. In 2023, she was appointed as expert consultant and panel reviewer for Nanosatellite
Development Project by MYSA. Recently, she was appointed as Malaysia Point-of-Contact (POC) for UNISECGlobal to ensure the space activities in the country is sustained in line with the goal of the consortium to
