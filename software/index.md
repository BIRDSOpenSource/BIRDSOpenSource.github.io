# ðŸ’» BIRDS Software Guide

This guide walks you through the software that powers BIRDS CubeSats â€” from low-level microcontroller code to high-level mission logic.

You'll find architecture diagrams, programming conventions, examples, and testing tools that help you work with or build upon the flight software.

---

## ðŸ§  What's Inside

- Bootloader and initialization routines
- Communication protocols (e.g., AX.25)
- Housekeeping and telemetry handling
- Payload command/control logic
- Sample ground station scripts

---

## ðŸ§° Development Workflow

The BIRDS software follows modular principles to support mission-specific customization while keeping a clean baseline. Key topics include:

- How to set up your development environment
- Coding standards and directory structure
- Simulating subsystems
- Flashing firmware and debugging

> ðŸ“¦ Example: See our [Hello World example](../software/examples/hello-world.md) for a minimal startup app.

## What tools do we use in development?
   - **Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools for Design**: Fusion 360
   - **Simulation Tools**: Thermal desktop, STK for mission analysis
   - **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Python 
   - **Programming Environment**: CCS Compiler, MPLAB IDE
   - **Communication Protocols**: UART, SPI
   - **Version Control**: Git/ [GitHub]
