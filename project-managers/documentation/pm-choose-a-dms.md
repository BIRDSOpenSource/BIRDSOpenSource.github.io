A document management system (DMS) is usually a computerized system used to store, share, track and manage files or documents. 

Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Google Drive can all be used for document management (DMS)

When choosing a DMS, you can consider things like:
- Security: Whether the system is built to ISO 27001 security standards 
- Lock-in: Whether you're required to store your documents with the DMS, which can lock you into their platform 
- Control: Whether the DMS offers fine-grained control over editing and access rights 


Microsoft Teams and Google Drive can be used together for document management, and users can also add third-party cloud storage options to Teams: 

### OneDrive
Users can share files with their team in Microsoft Teams by going to OneDrive > My Files. OneDrive is a good option for work in progress, as users can share files individually and work on them simultaneously. 

### Google Drive
Users can add Google Drive to a Microsoft Teams classroom, and then access their Google Drive when creating assignments and posts. Users can also add Google files and folders to Microsoft Teams by clicking the Google Drive button, signing in to their Google account, and allowing permissions. 

### Third-party cloud storage
Users can add third-party cloud storage options to Teams by using the Teams App Store. CloudFiles is one third-party option that is compatible with Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, and OneDrive. 

When choosing between OneDrive and Google Drive, users may consider their preference for Microsoft or Google. Google Drive may be a better option for casual users and small- to medium-sized businesses, as it offers a larger free plan and lower prices than OneDrive. OneDrive may be a better option for larger businesses, as it offers cheaper 1 TB storage and faster local file sync.
