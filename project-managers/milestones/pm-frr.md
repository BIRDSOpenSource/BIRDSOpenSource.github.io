### *Flight Readiness Review (FRR)*
- Flight Model Testing is the phase where the actual satellite, known as the Flight Model (FM), undergoes a series of rigorous tests to validate its performance under conditions that simulate the space environment. This is the final verification before launch.
- **Key Activities**:
  - **Functional Testing**: Verifying that each subsystem and the satellite as a whole function as expected.
  - **Environmental Testing**:
    - **Thermal Vacuum (TVT) Testing**: Ensuring the satellite can withstand the extreme temperatures and vacuum conditions of space.
    - **Vibration Testing**: Testing for structural integrity under launch conditions to ensure it can survive the launch vibrations.
  - **Deployment Testing**: Verifying the proper deployment of antennas, solar panels, or other movable parts.
- **Outcome**: Confirmation that the satellite is ready for launch. Any failures during this phase may require redesign, rework, or additional testing until issues are resolved and the satellite meets all operational standards.
