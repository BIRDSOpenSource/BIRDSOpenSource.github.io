# Preliminary Design Review (PDR)

The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) is a critical milestone in the satellite development process. It serves as a checkpoint to assess whether the preliminary design of the satellite meets the mission’s requirements and objectives. The PDR ensures that the basic design approach is sound before advancing to more detailed design work. This article explains the purpose, key activities, and outcomes of the PDR, as well as its importance in the satellite lifecycle.

## What is the Preliminary Design Review (PDR)?

The PDR is a comprehensive review of the satellite's preliminary design. It evaluates whether the design approach is feasible, aligns with mission requirements, and provides a solid foundation for detailed design work. The PDR involves stakeholders from across the project, including engineers, managers, and external reviewers.

### Key Activities During PDR

1. **Subsystem Design Overview**  
   Teams present initial design plans for key subsystems, such as the On-Board Computer (OBC), Electrical Power System (EPS), Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS), Communications (COM), payloads, and structure. This includes high-level descriptions of functionality and performance.

2. **Preliminary Schematics**  
   Preliminary circuit diagrams, mechanical layouts, and software architecture are presented. These schematics provide a visual representation of the design approach and help identify potential issues early.

3. **Interface Definition**  
   The interfaces between different subsystems are outlined. This includes mechanical, electrical, and software interfaces, ensuring that all subsystems can integrate seamlessly.

4. **Verification Plan**  
   A draft plan for how each requirement will be tested and verified in later phases is presented. This includes testing procedures, success criteria, and resource requirements.

### Outcome of the PDR

The primary outcome of the PDR is **approval to move to detailed design and further development**. A successful PDR means that the preliminary design is sound and that the team can proceed with refining and deepening their designs. Any unresolved issues or risks must be addressed before moving forward.

## Importance of the PDR

The PDR is a critical step in the satellite development process for several reasons:

- **Design Validation**: Ensures that the preliminary design meets mission requirements and provides a solid foundation for detailed design work.
- **Risk Identification**: Identifies potential risks and issues early in the design process, allowing for timely mitigation.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Provides a platform for stakeholders to review and approve the preliminary design.
- **Cost and Schedule Control**: Helps avoid costly changes and delays by validating the design approach before detailed design work begins.

## Role of the Project Manager in the PDR

The project manager plays a key role in ensuring the success of the PDR. Here’s what a project manager needs to know and do before the PDR:

1. **Coordinate Design Presentations**  
   The project manager ensures that all subsystems are prepared to present their preliminary designs. This includes organizing rehearsals and ensuring that all documentation is complete.

2. **Facilitate Interface Definition**  
   The project manager works with the team to define and document the interfaces between subsystems. This ensures that all subsystems can integrate seamlessly.

3. **Review Verification Plans**  
   The project manager ensures that a draft verification plan is in place. This includes identifying testing procedures, success criteria, and resource requirements.

4. **Engage Stakeholders**  
   The project manager involves all relevant stakeholders in the review process to ensure alignment and buy-in. This includes coordinating meetings and gathering feedback.

## Preparing for the PDR

To ensure a successful PDR, teams should:

- **Complete Preliminary Design Work**: Ensure that all subsystems have developed their preliminary designs and documentation.
- **Conduct Internal Reviews**: Hold pre-PDR reviews to identify and address any issues or gaps.
- **Document Everything**: Provide detailed documentation, including design plans, schematics, interface definitions, and verification plans.
- **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve all relevant stakeholders in the review process to ensure alignment and buy-in.
