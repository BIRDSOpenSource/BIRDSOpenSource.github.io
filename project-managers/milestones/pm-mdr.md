# Mission Definition Review (MDR)

The Mission Definition Review (MDR) is the first critical milestone in the lifecycle of a satellite project. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent phases, ensuring that the mission's objectives are clearly defined, feasible, and aligned with stakeholder expectations. This article explains the purpose, key activities, and outcomes of the MDR, as well as the responsibilities of the project manager in preparing for this review.

## What is the Mission Definition Review (MDR)?

The MDR is the initial phase where the primary objectives and feasibility of the satellite mission are assessed. It ensures that the mission concept aligns with stakeholder goals and meets basic feasibility criteria. The MDR is not just a formality; it is a rigorous evaluation that sets the stage for the entire project.

### Key Activities During MDR

1. **Requirements Definition**  
   Establishing the mission’s main objectives, such as scientific data collection, Earth observation, or communication. This involves identifying the key deliverables and success criteria for the mission.

2. **Concept Analysis**  
   Evaluating different mission concepts and selecting the most viable one. This includes assessing technical feasibility, resource availability, and alignment with stakeholder goals.

3. **Preliminary Budgeting**  
   Outlining initial cost estimates and resource needs. This step ensures that the mission is financially viable and that resources are allocated appropriately.

4. **Risk Assessment**  
   Identifying potential high-level risks and challenges. This includes technical, financial, and operational risks that could impact the mission's success.

### Outcome of the MDR

The primary outcome of the MDR is **approval to proceed to the design phase**. By the end of the review, the mission scope should be clearly defined, with initial high-level requirements documented. This provides a solid foundation for the next stages of the project.

## Role of the Project Manager in the MDR

The project manager plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of the MDR. Here’s what a project manager needs to know and do before the MDR:

1. **Ensure Subsystem Readiness**  
   The project manager should ensure that each subsystem team understands what they are required to present at the MDR. This includes clear documentation of their capabilities, constraints, and alignment with the mission objectives.

2. **Facilitate Stakeholder Alignment**  
   The project manager must ensure that all stakeholders are aligned on the mission’s goals and expectations. This involves coordinating meetings, gathering feedback, and resolving conflicts.

3. **Prepare Documentation**  
   The project manager is responsible for compiling and organizing all necessary documentation for the MDR. This includes mission objectives, concept analysis, budget estimates, and risk assessments.

4. **Conduct Pre-MDR Reviews**  
   Before the formal MDR, the project manager should conduct internal reviews to identify and address any gaps or issues. This ensures that the team is well-prepared and that the MDR runs smoothly.

## Importance of the MDR

The MDR is more than just a procedural step; it is a strategic exercise that ensures the mission is viable and well-defined. By conducting a thorough MDR, teams can:

- Avoid costly changes later in the project lifecycle.
- Ensure alignment between technical capabilities and mission objectives.
- Identify and mitigate risks early in the project.
- Secure stakeholder buy-in and support.
