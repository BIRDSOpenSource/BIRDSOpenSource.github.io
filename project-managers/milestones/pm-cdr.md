# Critical Design Review (CDR)

The Critical Design Review (CDR) is a pivotal milestone in the satellite development process. It represents the final evaluation of the detailed design before transitioning into production and assembly. The primary goal of the CDR is to ensure that the design meets all mission requirements, is manufacturable, and is testable. This article explains the purpose, key activities, and outcomes of the CDR, as well as its importance in the satellite lifecycle.

## What is the Critical Design Review (CDR)?

The CDR is an in-depth evaluation of the satellite's final design. It ensures that the design is complete, compliant with requirements, and ready for manufacturing and testing. The CDR is a rigorous review that involves stakeholders from across the project, including engineers, managers, and external reviewers.

### Key Activities During CDR

1. **Detailed Design Presentation**  
   Teams present detailed drawings, CAD models, circuit layouts, and software implementation. This includes subsystem-level designs as well as the integrated system design.

2. **Compliance Check**  
   The design is reviewed to ensure it adheres to industry standards, regulatory requirements, and internal specifications. This includes verifying that all mission requirements are met.

3. **Risk Mitigation Plans**  
   The updated risk register and contingency plans are reviewed to ensure that potential risks have been identified and addressed. This includes technical, operational, and logistical risks.

4. **Manufacturing Readiness**  
   The readiness of production facilities, supply chains, and assembly processes is assessed. This ensures that the design can be manufactured and assembled within the project's constraints.

### Outcome of the CDR

The primary outcome of the CDR is **approval to proceed to the manufacturing and integration phase**. A successful CDR means that the design is considered final, and the team can begin producing and assembling components. Any unresolved issues or risks must be addressed before moving forward.

## Importance of the CDR

The CDR is a critical step in the satellite development process for several reasons:

- **Design Validation**: Ensures that the design meets all mission requirements and is ready for production.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and addresses potential risks before they impact the manufacturing and assembly phases.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Provides a platform for stakeholders to review and approve the final design.
- **Cost and Schedule Control**: Helps avoid costly changes and delays by finalizing the design before production begins.

## Role of the Project Manager in the CDR

The project manager plays a key role in ensuring the success of the CDR. Hereâ€™s what a project manager needs to know and do before the CDR:

1. **Coordinate Design Presentations**  
   The project manager ensures that all subsystems are prepared to present their detailed designs. This includes organizing rehearsals and ensuring that all documentation is complete.

2. **Facilitate Compliance Checks**  
   The project manager works with the team to ensure that the design complies with all relevant standards and requirements. This may involve coordinating with external reviewers or regulatory bodies.

3. **Review Risk Mitigation Plans**  
   The project manager ensures that the risk register is up to date and that contingency plans are in place. This includes addressing any unresolved risks before the CDR.

4. **Assess Manufacturing Readiness**  
   The project manager works with the manufacturing and supply chain teams to ensure that production facilities and processes are ready. This includes verifying that all necessary materials and equipment are available.

## Preparing for the CDR

To ensure a successful CDR, teams should:

- **Complete All Design Work**: Ensure that all subsystems have finalized their designs and documentation.
- **Conduct Internal Reviews**: Hold pre-CDR reviews to identify and address any issues or gaps.
- **Engage Stakeholders**: Involve all relevant stakeholders in the review process to ensure alignment and buy-in.
- **Document Everything**: Provide detailed documentation, including design drawings, risk assessments, and compliance reports.
