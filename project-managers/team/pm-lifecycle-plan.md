### **Notes:**  
{: .no_toc }
- **Overlaps:** Some phases overlap, especially design, procurement, and testing.  
- **Customization:** The schedule depends on mission complexity, budget, and team size.  
- **Milestone Reviews:** Regular reviews ensure progress aligns with goals.  


In project management, schedules are used to manage and track time, resources, and deliverables. Different **types of schedules** serve distinct purposes, and in a CubeSat project, you might encounter or use several of these. Here's a breakdown:

---

## **Types of Schedules**  

### **1. Master Schedule**  
{: .no_toc }
- **Purpose:**  
  Provides a high-level overview of the entire project timeline.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Summarizes all phases (concept, design, testing, etc.).  
  - Used for stakeholder communication and major milestone tracking.  
- **Example Milestones in a CubeSat Project:**  
  - Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  
  - Critical Design Review (CDR).  
  - Launch Readiness.  

### **2. Detailed Schedule**  
{: .no_toc }
- **Purpose:**  
  Breaks down each phase into specific tasks and sub-tasks.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Includes task dependencies and durations.  
  - Assigns resources to tasks.  
  - Often visualized using Gantt charts.  
- **Use Case:**  
  Managing subsystem developments like ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System).  

### **3. Critical Path Schedule** 
{: .no_toc } 
- **Purpose:**  
  Focuses on the sequence of tasks that determine the projectâ€™s overall duration.  
- **Key Features:**
