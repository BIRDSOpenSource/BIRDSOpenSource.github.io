Define the purpose: Make sure there's a clear reason for the meeting and that it's focused. 
Prepare an agenda: Create a list of topics to be discussed in a logical order. Consider what needs to be addressed and what can wait for another time. You can use a meeting agenda app to collaborate on the agenda and assign action items. 
Invite the right people: The number of attendees depends on the purpose of the meeting. For example, you might invite more people to share ideas, but fewer for problem-solving or decision-making. 
Set the date and time: Consider whether the meeting will be online or in person. 
Communicate with participants: Request confirmation of attendance and communicate with participants beforehand. 
Organize the meeting room: A well-organized meeting room can help attendees focus and achieve the meeting's goals. 
Make the meeting participatory: Engage participants and encourage them to work together to solve problems. 
Follow up: Report on the meeting and follow up on next steps. 
Ask for feedback: Get input from your team about the meeting.

## Organise weekly team meetings
this is the opportunity for the whole team to gather and share updates on their progress. it is not the places to bring up new problem that have not been attemped to be solved.

## Organise sub-team meetings
on a student it is safe to assume most members have no prior experience. this is an opportunity before or after the weekly meeting to check in on subteams and assess how well the members are managing their tasks, ask them if they need any help or have found any difficulties, and reiterate their deliverables for the next milestone review.
