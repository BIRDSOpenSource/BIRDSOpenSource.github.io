# Assembling the Access Cable

## Overview
This guide explains how to assemble the access cable, including crimping wires, soldering, securing with Araldite, and verifying connections.

## Before You Start
Before assembling the access cable, ensure you have:

* Crimping tool
* Soldering iron and solder
* Heat shrink tubing
* Araldite epoxy
* Multimeter for continuity checks
* Wire stripper and cutter
* Required connectors and wires

## Steps

1. **Prepare the Wires**
    - Cut wires to the required length.
    - Strip the insulation at the ends using a wire stripper.

2. **Crimp the Connectors**
    - Insert the stripped wire into the crimp terminal.
    - Use the crimping tool to securely fasten the connection.
    - Check for a firm grip by slightly pulling the wire.

3. **Solder the Connections**
    - Apply solder to each crimped terminal for extra strength and reliability.
    - Ensure a clean and solid solder joint.

4. **Secure with Heat Shrink Tubing**
    - Slide heat shrink tubing over each soldered connection.
    - Use a heat gun to shrink and insulate the connection.

5. **Apply Araldite for Additional Securing**
    - At the ends of the cable, apply Araldite epoxy to reinforce and protect the connections.
    - Let it cure as per the manufacturer's instructions.

6. **Check Connections**
    - Use a multimeter to check continuity after each step.
    - Ensure all connections are properly made before finalizing the assembly.
