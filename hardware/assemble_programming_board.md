# Assembling the Programming Board

## Overview
This guide explains how to assemble the programming board, including crimping wires, soldering, and final assembly steps.

## Before You Start
Before assembling the programming board, ensure you have the following:

* Wire crimping tool
* Soldering iron and solder
* Heat shrink tubing
* Required connectors and wires
* PCB and components
* Multimeter for testing
* Safety goggles and gloves

## Assembly Steps

1. **Prepare the Components**
    * Lay out all required components and verify their specifications.
    * Cut wires to the appropriate lengths for connections.

2. **Crimping Wires**
    * Strip the wire ends to expose enough conductor for crimping.
    * Use a crimping tool to attach the connectors securely.
    * Verify crimped connections for stability and conductivity.

3. **Soldering Components**
    * Position components on the PCB as per the schematic layout.
    * Heat the soldering iron and apply solder to each connection point.
    * Inspect solder joints for a clean, strong connection.

4. **Final Assembly**
    * Secure all components in place and ensure proper alignment.
    * Use heat shrink tubing for insulation where necessary.
    * Check continuity with a multimeter before powering up.
