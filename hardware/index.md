# ðŸ”© BIRDS Hardware Guide

This section provides detailed documentation on the physical components that make up the BIRDS CubeSat bus. With step-by-step guides for designing and assembling hardware for the system. These tutorials will help you with assembling the necessary boards, preparing cables, and setting up for integration.

From power systems to communication boards, sensors to solar panels, you'll find background explanations, electrical schematics, usage notes, and assembly tips to support both education and implementation.
