# Hardware and Components

## Selecting and Integrating Transceivers
Commonly used transceivers in CubeSat projects.
Power, size, and thermal considerations.



## Power Budgeting for the Communication Subsystem
Estimating power needs for transmission and reception.
Power efficiency in relation to CubeSat size constraints.


## Testing and Verifying RF Components
Key tests: impedance matching, VSWR, and RF performance.
Practical tools: spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, etc.
