## Antenna Board

![Antenna Board PCB](/assets/images/Antenna-Board.png)

The antenna board carries both the communication antennas as well as the GPS antenna. The comms antenna is a tape antenna, folded in a ring and held in place by a resistor heater and string. At the time of deployment, this antenna springs open and starts to function. The GPS Antenna is a simple ceramic antenna, no release mechanism required.
