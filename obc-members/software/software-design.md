## Introduction

In this section, we’ll add some of your organization’s software components into the Software Catalog — and create a Software Template that captures your organization’s best practices for at least one engineering discipline.

Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you’ve completed Standing Up Backstage. Before you continue, make sure that:
