# Hardware Design and Selection

3. **Choosing the Right Microcontroller or Microprocessor**
   - Trade-offs between power consumption, computational power, and radiation tolerance.
   - Examples: ARM Cortex-M series, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone.

4. **Memory Systems in CubeSat OBCs**
   - Types of memory (RAM, ROM, EEPROM, Flash).
   - Strategies for data storage and retrieval during a mission.

5. **Fault Tolerant Hardware Design**
   - Mitigating radiation effects: SEU (Single Event Upset) and TID (Total Ionizing Dose).
   - Redundancy and watchdog timers.

6. **Designing and Testing PCB Layouts for the OBC**
   - Considerations for thermal management, size constraints, and EMI/EMC.
