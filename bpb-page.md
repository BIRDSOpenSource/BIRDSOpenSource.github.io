## Backplane Board

![Backplane Board Photo](./images/BPB-Board.png)

This is the backplane board used in BIRDS 3 and 4. As previously mentioned, this board's function is to connect all the other boards, including the mission ones, together. Specifically, the board in the picture is the one without CPLD which is used to redirect connections when needed.
