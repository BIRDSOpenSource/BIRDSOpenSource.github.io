## üß≠ What Is This Project?

BIRDS Open Source is an educational satellite development platform based on the **Kyutech BIRDS model**, now made openly accessible for learning and collaboration. It includes software, hardware, documentation, and team workflows to help you simulate or build a real CubeSat.

The Joint Global Multi-Nations Birds Satellite project, or BIRDS project for short, was established by the Kyushu Institute of Technology ([Kyutech](https://www.kyutech.ac.jp/english/)) to help countries build their first satellite. Young engineers from select countries get to learn about space engineering at Kyutech, mostly using the 1U CubeSat.  

The BIRDS project has two main objectives:

1. Experience the entire cycle of a satellite project, from mission definition to operation, in a hands-on manner.
2. Have a strategy for sustainability after the training.

The primary goal is not to build a satellite, but to establish a sustainable space program in each member country.   

So far, there have been 4 completed and one ongoing BIRDS missions, which are:
1. BIRDS-1: Bangladesh, Japan, Mongolia, Ghana and Nigeria  .
2. BIRDS-2: Bhutan, Philippines and Malaysia.
3. BIRDS-3: Japan, Sri Lanka and Nepal.  
4. BIRDS-4: Japan, Philippines and Paraguay.  
5. BIRDS-5: Japan, Uganda and Zimbabwe.   


Kyutech's fellowship programs (PNST) and Space Engineering International Course (SEIC) provide hands-on space engineering training using CubeSat development, enabling each mission to be completed in two years. The goal of open sourcing the process is to enable teams from across the world to develop their own countries' first satellites.
