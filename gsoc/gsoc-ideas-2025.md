- Develop and test a **secure update protocol** for transmitting new firmware from the ground station.  

ðŸ›  **Skills Required**:  
- Embedded C  
- RTOS  
- Low-level firmware development  
- Satellite communications  

ðŸ“† **Project Size**: **Large (350 hours)**  
ðŸ•’ **Duration**: **12 weeks**

## 3. KiCad Design of an Open-Source CubeSat Onboard Computer (OBC)  
### ðŸ”¹ Project Title: *Developing an Open-Source CubeSat OBC PCB using KiCad*  
ðŸ“Œ **Description**: Design and document a fully open-source **Onboard Computer (OBC) PCB** using **KiCad**, making it easy for CubeSat teams to adapt and use. We currently get the board design and fabrication done with **[Sagami Tsushin](https://www.sagami-net.co.jp/)**, but users have said it is difficult to do from their country. We want to make a design that can be sent to **any PCB manufacturer** near users.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**:  
- With the schematic already shared, design a PCB layout for a CubeSat OBC.  
- Ensure the board meets **CubeSat standard interfaces** and can be easily integrated with BIRDS software.  
- Generate **BOM (Bill of Materials)**, fabrication files, and a user manual for teams that want to replicate or improve the design.  

ðŸ›  **Skills Required**:  
- KiCad  
- PCB design  
- Hardware development  
- Embedded systems  

ðŸ“† **Project Size**: **Medium (175 hours)**  
ðŸ•’ **Duration**: **12 weeks**

## 4. Development of a Web-Based Ground Station Dashboard for BIRDS CubeSats  
### ðŸ”¹ Project Title: *Building a Web-Based Dashboard for CubeSat Ground Stations*  
ðŸ“Œ **Description**: Develop a **real-time dashboard** that allows ground station operators to **monitor, control, and visualize telemetry** from CubeSats.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**:  
- Create a **web-based interface** for satellite health monitoring (battery, temperature, comms status, etc.).  
- Implement real-time **graphing and logging** of telemetry data.  
- Develop features for **command uplink and event notifications**.  

ðŸ›  **Skills Required**:  
- Web development (React, Vue, or Django)  
- Real-time data visualization  
- Database management  

ðŸ“† **Project Size**: **Large (350 hours)**  
ðŸ•’ **Duration**: **12 weeks**

## 5. CubeSat Simulation Framework for Testing OBC Software  
### ðŸ”¹ Project Title: *Developing a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) CubeSat Simulation Framework*  
ðŸ“Œ **Description**: Create a **simulation environment** where CubeSat software can be tested before deployment, reducing hardware testing costs and debugging time.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**:  
- Develop a **software model** of a CubeSat, including sensors, actuators, and communication interfaces.  
- Integrate with existing BIRDS software to test firmware behavior under simulated space conditions.  
- Allow users to run **automated tests** to validate mission scenarios.  

ðŸ›  **Skills Required**:  
- Python  
- C++  
- Simulation frameworks  
- Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing  

ðŸ“† **Project Size**: **Large (350 hours)**  
ðŸ•’ **Duration**: **12 weeks**

## 6. Port Firmware Code to an Open Compiler  
### ðŸ”¹ Project Title: *Migrating BIRDS Firmware from CCS Compiler to an Open Compiler*  
ðŸ“Œ **Description**: We currently use **CCS Compiler**, which is proprietary, so we want to make the firmware compatible with an **open compiler** like **Microchip XC8**.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**:  
- Analyze the existing firmware and dependencies on CCS.  
- Port the code to XC8 while ensuring compatibility and functionality.  
- Perform validation tests to confirm proper operation.  

ðŸ›  **Skills Required**:
